            <h2>About MS Dhoni</h2>
            <p>
                Mahendra Singh Dhoni, born July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, is a legendary
                Indian cricketer known for his calm leadership and finishing prowess.
                Rising from a small town with no cricketing background, he conquered
                the world stage through pure grit and talent.
            </p>
            <p>
                He led India to all major ICC titles‚Äîthe 2007 T20 World Cup, the 2011
                ODI World Cup, and the 2013 Champions Trophy. His unflappable nature
                under pressure earned him the nickname "Captain Cool."
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond statistics, Dhoni inspired millions with his humility,
                simplicity, and ability to stay grounded even at the peak of fame.
